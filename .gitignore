# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# TODO Comment out these rules if you are OK with secrets being uploaded to the repo
!secrets.yml

# Ignore application configuration
/config/application.yml

# npm packages
node_modules

# webpack bundle
bundle.js
bundle.js.map
